‚úÖ Final Power BI Implementation Plan
1. Create a Summary Table with the Last Message
Here's a DAX summary table with just the last message per filename:
DAX
CopyEdit
LastLogPerFilename =
ADDCOLUMNS (
    SUMMARIZE ( Log, Log[filename] ),
    "LastTimestamp", 
        CALCULATE ( MAX ( Log[timestamp] ) ),
    "LastMessage",
        CALCULATE (
            FIRSTNONBLANK ( Log[content.detail], 1 ),
            FILTER (
                Log,
                Log[timestamp] = CALCULATE ( MAX ( Log[timestamp] ) )
                    && Log[filename] = EARLIER ( Log[filename] )
            )
        )
)
________________________________________
2. Flag "Not Completed" Requests
Add a calculated column:
DAX
CopyEdit
IsNotCompleted =
VAR Msg = [LastMessage]
RETURN
    IF (
        NOT (
            CONTAINSSTRING ( LOWER(Msg), "message sent" )
            || CONTAINSSTRING ( LOWER(Msg), "failed" )
        ),
        TRUE(),
        FALSE()
    )
This handles cases like:
‚Ä¢	"processing JSON" ‚úÖ ‚Üí not completed
‚Ä¢	"file received" ‚úÖ ‚Üí not completed
‚Ä¢	"message sent to GSC" ‚ùå ‚Üí completed
‚Ä¢	"processing failed" ‚ùå ‚Üí failed, also completed in your logic

3. Visualizations to Build
Now you can create visuals like:
‚Ä¢	Card: Total number of incomplete requests:
DAX
CopyEdit
IncompleteRequestCount = 
COUNTROWS (
    FILTER ( LastLogPerFilename, [IsNotCompleted] = TRUE() )
)
‚Ä¢	Table: filename, LastMessage, IsNotCompleted
‚Ä¢	Bar chart: Number of "not completed" requests by day (based on LastTimestamp)
________________________________________
üîß Optional: Handle More Message Variants
If message types vary more (e.g., "message dispatched", "failed to deliver"), you could expand the logic:
DAX
CopyEdit
IsNotCompleted =
VAR Msg = LOWER ( [LastMessage] )
RETURN
    IF (
        NOT (
            CONTAINSSTRING ( Msg, "message sent" )
            || CONTAINSSTRING ( Msg, "dispatched" )
            || CONTAINSSTRING ( Msg, "failed" )
        ),
        TRUE(),
        FALSE()
    )

Let me know if you'd like to bundle this into a reusable Power BI measure, or turn it into a dataflow step.

Great ‚Äî let's create a Power BI DAX measure that counts how many requests (filenames) are not completed, based on the last log entry per filename.
________________________________________
‚úÖ Final DAX Measure: IncompleteRequestCount
Assuming your table is called Log and it contains:
‚Ä¢	filename
‚Ä¢	timestamp
‚Ä¢	content.detail
Here‚Äôs the full measure:
DAX
CopyEdit
IncompleteRequestCount =
VAR LatestLogs =
    ADDCOLUMNS (
        SUMMARIZE ( Log, Log[filename] ),
        "LastTimestamp",
            CALCULATE ( MAX ( Log[timestamp] ) )
    )

VAR LogsWithLastMessages =
    ADDCOLUMNS (
        LatestLogs,
        "LastMessage",
            CALCULATE (
                MAX ( Log[content.detail] ),
                FILTER (
                    Log,
                    Log[filename] = EARLIER ( Log[filename] ) &&
                    Log[timestamp] = EARLIER ( [LastTimestamp] )
                )
            )
    )

VAR Filtered =
    FILTER (
        LogsWithLastMessages,
        NOT (
            CONTAINSSTRING ( LOWER ( [LastMessage] ), "message sent" ) ||
            CONTAINSSTRING ( LOWER ( [LastMessage] ), "failed" )
        )
    )

RETURN
    COUNTROWS ( Filtered )
________________________________________
üîç What This Does:
1.	Gets the latest timestamp per filename
2.	Grabs the corresponding last message
3.	Filters out those that contain "message sent" or "failed"
4.	Returns the count of remaining ones ‚Äî these are your "not completed" requests
________________________________________
üí° Usage
‚Ä¢	Use this measure in a card visual to display total incomplete requests.
‚Ä¢	You can also reuse the logic pattern to build other measures like:
o	A table of all incomplete requests
o	Percent completed vs not completed
